    <h1 style="color: white">I understand this isn't anywhere near the assignment we were given.
    If I'm being honest, I've been dealing with 4 other classes as well as 12-hour work days 5-6 days a week.
        Just didn't make the time for this assignment. Just figured I'd share this though to show I kinda get the concept
        Though this wasn't done in vue, this WAS populated by a javascript dictionary with nothing but a section tag and this singular H1 in the body on the html file. Did this back in N220, believe you were my TA for that class with Todd ;D
        |(Also, goes without saying, but I'm not expecting any poitns for this)|
